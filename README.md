#Weather App

Hello! This is the source for my Weather App take-home project.

**Bonus features:**
I made it so that the user can continuously search for weather readings and have each reading displayed in a list.
I created a simple REST API consisting of just one route, to fetch data from OpenWeatherMap's API.

**Please note:**
I decided to use NextJS for the app, because I saw that it is used in your workplace, comes with a CSS in JS solution which I realize is a requirement for this take-home project and also allows for quick/simple API creation.
I apologize for using window.alert() to display errors for bad input/failed get requests, I unfortunately did not have time to implement a dialog system.
